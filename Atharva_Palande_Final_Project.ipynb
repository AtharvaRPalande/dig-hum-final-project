    "## Comparative Analysis: A Study in Scarlet and The Moonstone (Betteredge Part 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "My analysis focuses on the similarities and differences of *The Moonstone* and *A Study in Scarlet*. Both texts are the archetypal detective novels and have many common themes. In this, I wanted to explore the character descriptions of both Sergeant Cuff and Sherlock Holmes, the sentiments of the text (primarily the “First Period” for *The Moonstone*), and the types of verbs used throughout the text. I believe that this gives an actionable insight into both texts and allows for a proper analysis to be completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "*The Moonstone*, written in 1861 by Wilkie Collins, is the cornerstone of the detective genre. Many common tropes such as (1) loyalty to the client, (2) being economical, (3) loyalty to the profession, (4) cooperation with the authorities, (5) survivalist, and (6) unwillingness to being duped are established within The Moonstone and are seen in the actions of Sergeant Cuff (Marling). \n",
    "\n",
    "The second text, *A Study in Scarlet*, is written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in 1887. It’s the introduction into the world of Sherlock Holmes and is split into two different parts. The first half covers the investigation of a murder by a cab-driver named Jefferson Hope and his arrest. The second half covers the backstory of Hope and how Holmes approached his deduction. At the end, however, Hope dies the day before he is supposed to appear at court. But more importantly for the series, after the police get the credit, Watson decides that he needs to “publish” the stories (in-universe) to ensure that Holmes is credited as well, thus kicking off the world of Sherlock Holmes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before I began my analysis, I had the general understanding that Sergeant Cuff was more prevalent in the first half of the text. Thus, it seemed to be the best area to carry out analysis in. Of course, within the first half, there are many periods as well with different characters who write them out. That’s why I needed to divide the text into the subsequent different parts (i.e. Betteredege, Clack, Bruff, Blake, etc) and determine where he was referenced the most within those areas. Completing a dispersion plot led me to see that the “First Period” was the ideal place to analyze the character differences between both Sergeant Cuff and Sherlock Holmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing a collocation on “Cuff” in the “First Period,” I noticed that he was referenced in conjunction with Betteredge (a loyal sidekick) and roses (his strange hobby). He’s described as “miserably lean” and Betteredge even goes as far as to describe him as “a less comforting officer to look at” when in comparison to Sergeant Seegrave. Of course, later on, he does attempt to also solve the mystery at hand by recreating the moment of it being stolen and does make a decent headway into the case itself before being let go. But yet throughout, he is looked upon as a confident figure and someone who can/could have solved the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, comparing these character descriptions to Sherlock, we find a lot of similar tropes in regards practicing a “consultancy” but for his clients in regard to crime. He’s described in conjunction with his “musical disquisition” or the fact that he “sniffed sardonically.” Of course, he is also usually referenced in the general vicinity of Dr. Watson as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing these similarities, it does seem that the six most common tropes are followed in Doyle’s writing. Holmes also follows the ideas of having a “loyal sidekick” (Watson) and an unassuming hobby for someone of his nature (the violin). Moreover, he too does exemplify a lot of the character descriptions that Sergeant Cuff has with his own style of “gauntness” and a dominating figure when it comes to height (of course that is subject to what the case requires). Moreover, much like Cuff, he is loyal to the case and client, is stringent with money (most seen when apartment hunting), and willing to work with the police. In regard to solving the case, he follows through on the procedural steps that Doyle’s predecessor wrote. Essentially, this helps confirm the detective tropes that Marling wrote about in his own analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another focus of mine was to look at the average sentiment per sentence in the text. This would give us a general idea of what the tone and mood is throughout the text. Strikingly enough, *The Moonstone* starts out quite positive. This might be explained away by the overall mood of the festivity, but as expected, the mood takes a drop around the time when the diamond is stolen. As expected, there are oscillations between the positive and the negative, but around the halfway mark, the negative seems to slowly decrease. This can be explained by a progress in the investigation itself and it seemingly ends on a more or less average note – with the negative far decreased compared to where it ranging to earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "*A Study in Scarlet* takes a different route in that regard. It does start off with the vague sense of mystery and here too, the sentiment hovers between the positive and the negative. But what’s striking is what happened in the second half which almost perfectly encapsulates the tragic second part of the text – where everything goes wrong for the suspect back in Utah. And the tragedy continues to happen until the very near end where Hope (the suspect) has an aneurism the night before he goes to trial. In the end, as with any universal conclusion, the text returns to normal and seemingly peters out in regard to emotion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, comparing all of this in such a miniscule and inexact format is inefficient. While it does allow a viewer to see the sharp spikes, it remains impossible to accurately quantify the sentiment (if at all). That’s why I included a bar chart – to provide a way to reasonably compare both texts. And I found what I expected to see from the rough estimate I had made visually: *A Study in Scarlet* had a less positive sentiment compared to *The Moonstone*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I find myself attributing this to one reason: the fact that I only picked a certain section of *The Moonstone* while only allowing *A Study in Scarlet* to reach a proper conclusion. Moreover, I find it that *The Moonstone* is quite “accepting” of this loss and while there is an initial backlash and it remains the object of desire until the end (when it is recovered) – there’s no specific “rush” to find it and recover it. Furthermore, the loss of the diamond is not drastic in regards to death or murder, unlike Hope’s story in Utah with the Mormons and in England as well. In a sense, words such as “death” or “murder” will further push the sentiment down compared to the loss of only a diamond. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think the key takeaway here is that this only goes further into the general depth of the Doyle’s stories: they are serious cases involving major losses, murder, and death. Oftentimes, they involve themes that involve the undercurrent of drugs, depression, affairs amongst many others. Of course, *The Moonstone* does delve into this, it does not do it to the extent that Doyle does in his works by making it the center of whatever he writes oftentimes (Worsley).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing I wanted to focus on, but not as meaningful, was the amount of verbs present in the separate texts. Unfortunately, at least to me, the results did provide anything exceedingly meaningful. Both lists had quite common verbs provided in the top 20. Nonetheless, if I could glean one nugget of information from them was the *A Study in Scarlet* simply had a lot more verbs. Of course, one of the reasons would be the fact that the text is simply longer than *The Moonstone*. Thus, the case is not allowed to completely unravel itself and find a suitable conclusion. By the close of the first part, there are still more than a handful of threads to wrap up. In that sense, *The Moonstone* takes a much slower pace. This becomes especially evident near the end of the first part because there seems to be an aspect of acceptance settling into the cast of characters – thus pushing the issue further down the road. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, it cannot help but strike me that Doyle’s work is simply more action-orientated compared to Collin’s. For Doyle, this work – while about the procedural work – is the action behind getting to the result of who committed the crime. Moreover, both Sherlock and Watson do more than just investigate what happened, but they also interact with the crime scene, they have banter, and they come to life through this. Collin’s Cuff and his work on the other hand seems more detached compared to his contemporary. Sergeant Cuff and Betteredge investigate, but they never truly chase the mystery to the extent that Sherlock and Watson do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Still, this comes with the disclaimer and the important lesson that not everything that is analyzed is useful and neither should there be the expectation of usefulness. Understanding this and learning from it will ensure that time is not needlessly spent chasing rabbit holes and that all types of analysis necessarily hold value in particular circumstances. If nothing else, had I been even a bit unluckier, those results would simply have gone down the drain. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, both texts have both striking similarities and striking differences. The key takeaway that I had was that while they follow the common themes and tropes of a detective novel, they differ in the type of “sentiment” and in how dark they can become. In my analysis, I found the similarities and differences in both detectives, the sentiments of the text in how it progresses and is presented, and the types of verbs that are presented. Yet, it does become clear that *The Moonstone* was instrumental in being one of the first “true” detective novels that paved the way for procedurals such as *A Study in Scarlet*. In that, *The Moonstone* holds tremendous literary value. \n",
